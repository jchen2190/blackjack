# Blackjack

## General
This project is based on the game BlackJack.

## Game Rules
The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21. <br>
The player must decide whether to "hit" (ask for another card) or "stand" (not ask another card), until deciding to "stand" or go "bust" (if player's card is over 21). Then it will be the dealer's turn unless the player has already lost.
